Recently, Iâ€™ve developed a deep appreciation for jazz and pop music. I listen to these genres pretty much every single day day, and this
interest sparked my curiosity to learn more about its history, evolution, and the remarkable musicians who have contributed to its 
transformation as the decades rolled by. 
 
 So, I decided to combine my passion for jazz and drive to develop my development skills, and created a website where I picked some of the most 
 influential women in the genre, listed their accomplishments, and then presented them to my "Women in Music" class. Linked in this repository
 is the code and overall structure of the site. Additionally, You can view the live version of the site here:
