                Dinah Washington, born Ruth Lee Jones in 1924, was a renowned vocalist who is remembered as one of the great voices of R&B and jazz. 
                She was known for her versatility and range, which from the early 1940s to late 1950s saw her consistently top R&B charts, even winning 
                a Grammy for her song "What a Difference a Day Makes." Her style blended elements of jazz, blues, and R&B; this, enhanced with her wonderful 
                voice control and delivery, made her impossible to ignore. Throughout her career, she collaborated with several other jazz musicians such as 
                Clark Terry and Cannonball Adderley, producing a great deal of hits which we still remember her by today.

                Outside of music, Washington was also known for her bold personality and enticing stage presence, which enchanted anyone who came in contact 
                and worked with her. Unfortunately, she died very young at the age of 39, but her legacy continues to inspire generations of vocalists today 
                and no doubt in the years to come. In 1993, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, cementing her status as one of the most influential 
                voices in music history.
