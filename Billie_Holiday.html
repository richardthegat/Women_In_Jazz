                Billie Holiday, born Eleanora Fagan in 1915, is considered one of the greatest 
                jazz vocalists of all time. She was born to a turbulent family and had no formal 
                musical training; however, by the time of her career in the 1930s, she had developed
                a unique voice that conveyed deep emotion and vulnerability. In her time, she 
                collaborated with legendary musicians like Lester Young and Artie Shaw, who helped 
                write and record classics such as "Strange Fruit" and "God Bless the Child."

                Her life was marked by personal struggles, including substance abuse and legal troubles, which 
                she often channeled into her music. Despite these challenges, Holiday's impact on jazz and popular 
                music remains profound. She won five Grammy Awards, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall 
                of Fame, and continues to be celebrated as one of the most influential singers in jazz history.
